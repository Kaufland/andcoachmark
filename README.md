## Feature

* The Description Text dynamically renders text on top or bottom.
* The ActionDescriptionText (Text with arrow to the circle) dynamically renders left/top/bottom/right with this priority.
* These both views can be customized - the library takes inflated views as parameter.
* Aboved described rendering strategy can be replaced by own implementations or the priority of the available strategies can be changed.
* Decide how the button that closes the coachmark should appear (cancel/ok on right side, ok button below description, no button just click to dismiss). It's also possible to write own rendering.
* All colors and texts can be changed when setting up the Coachmark with the provided Builder.

## Implementation

TBD
